## Project Features
Real-Time Editing: Supports concurrent document editing, allowing multiple users to make changes simultaneously. Updates are synchronized instantly across sessions, fostering smooth teamwork and minimizing issues with version control.

Federated Learning: Utilizes federated learning to enhance the collaborative editing experience by learning from user interactions without compromising privacy. Each user’s local data contributes to optimizing the system collectively, while keeping individual data secure.

FTP Integration: Incorporates FTP (File Transfer Protocol) for secure file management, enabling reliable upload, retrieval, and storage across servers. This ensures accessibility and document safety in various network settings.
